    <h2>Hello,</h2>

    <p>
      Here's the follow up for Web Lit - Lesson 1. You can find the slides from Lesson 1,

              <a href="http://uprightnetizen.com/gta/web-literacy/lesson-1/">here</a>.

      It's in the usual place, over at good ol' upright netizen. Someday I promise I'll even
      put a link on the front page. If you forgot what the homework was for next week, don't
      worry, we've got you covered.

          Bonus Content : So I forgot to mention that scoping H1's inside of an hgroup is actually pretty
          cutting edge. So if you look at this page in a browser, you'll notice that it looks pretty much
          like your standard h1.

        <h2>Let's start a project</h2>

        <p>
          This week we're going to start a project that you will continue to build on for the next 5 weeks.
          I suggested a portfolio for the work you've done a Gilt. But if that's not your jam, you can start
          a web site about anything! It does need to be something that we can incorporate all the concepts of
          this class into, which are document structure (paragraphs, headings, sections, lists, and maybe tables),
          images, links (so, it's going to need multiple pages), and lots of pretty CSS interactions.
        </p>

        <p>
          For this week, I'd like to get started with one simple page that will act as the landing page for your
          project. I'd like you to use the following tags in some form or fashion before next week.

          <ul> Tags to use:
            <li>
              html, head, body
            </li>
            <li>
              header, footer, section, article<em>(optional)</em>, div
            </li>
            <li>
              At least one list
              <ul>
                <li>ul, li</li>
                <li>ol, li</li>
                <li>dl, dt, dd</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              At least three of these
              <ul>
                <li>strong</li>
                <li>em</li>
                <li>blockquote</li>
                <li>q</li>
                <li>abbr</li>
                <li>cite</li>
                <li>dfn</li>
                <li>address</li>
                <li>ins</li>
                <li>del</li>
                <li>s, strike</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
